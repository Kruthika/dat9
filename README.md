### Python Resources
* [Codecademy's Python course](http://www.codecademy.com/en/tracks/python): Good beginner material, including tons of in-browser exercises.
* [DataQuest](https://dataquest.io/): Similar interface to Codecademy, but focused on teaching Python in the context of data science.
* [Google's Python Class](https://developers.google.com/edu/python/): Slightly more advanced, including hours of useful lecture videos and downloadable exercises (with solutions).
* [A Crash Course in Python for Scientists](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/gist/rpmuller/5920182): Read through the Overview section for a quick introduction to Python.
* [Python for Informatics](http://www.pythonlearn.com/book.php): A very beginner-oriented book, with associated [slides](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B7X1ycQalUnyal9yeUx3VW81VDg&usp=sharing) and [videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlRFEj9H3Oj4JXIwMwN1_ss1Tk8wZShEJ).
* [Beginner](code/00_python_beginner_workshop.py) and [intermediate](code/00_python_intermediate_workshop.py) workshop code: Useful for review and reference.
* [Python 2.7x Reference Guide](https://github.com/vybstat/python-reference/blob/master/reference.py): Beginner-oriented guide that demonstrates a ton of Python concepts through short, well-commented examples.
* [Python Tutor](http://pythontutor.com/): Allows you to visualize the execution of Python code.
